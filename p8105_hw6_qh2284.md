## Problem 1

``` r
# load the dataset
homi = read_csv("./dataset/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

**Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. "Baltimore, MD"), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don't report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or `black`.
Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric.**

``` r
homi <- homi %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste0(city,", ",state),
    solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest",1,0)) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

**For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a
logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and
victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of `glm` as an R
object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this object; and obtain the estimate
and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables
fixed.**

``` r
balt = homi %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>% 
  select(solved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex) %>%
  mutate(victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female"))
```

``` r
balt_model = balt %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
```

``` r
# save R object
save(balt_model, file = "./result/Baltimore_logistic_model.RData")
```

``` r
balt_model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term             | estimate | std.error | statistic | p.value |
|:-----------------|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)      |    0.310 |     0.171 |     1.810 |   0.070 |
| victim_age       |   -0.007 |     0.003 |    -2.024 |   0.043 |
| victim_raceWhite |    0.842 |     0.175 |     4.818 |   0.000 |
| victim_sexMale   |   -0.854 |     0.138 |    -6.184 |   0.000 |

``` r
odd_ci_balt = balt_model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
  filter(term == 'victim_sexMale') %>% 
  summarise(estimate = estimate,
            OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         OR_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error) ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

odd_ci_balt
```

|---------:|------:|---------:|---------:|
|   -0.854 | 0.426 |    0.325 |    0.558 |

**Now run `glm` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a "tidy" pipeline, making use
of `purrr::map`, list columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.**

``` r
# create a function
all_model = function(citystate){
  city_glm = homi %>% 
    filter(city_state == citystate) %>% 
    glm(solved ~ victim_sex + victim_race + victim_age, family = binomial, data = .) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
    summarise(
         estimate = estimate,
         OR = exp(estimate), 
         OR_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error), 
         OR_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error))
    
    city_glm
}
```

``` r
glm_all = homi %>%
  dplyr::select(city_state) %>%
  unique() %>%
  mutate(glm = map(city_state, all_model)) %>% 
  unnest(glm) %>% 
  arrange(desc(OR))

**Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.**

``` r
ggplot(glm_all, aes(x=OR, y = fct_reorder(city_state, OR))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = OR_lower, xmax = OR_upper)) +
  labs(x = 'OR with 95% CI', y = 'city_state', title = 'Estimated ORs and CIs for each city') +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 1,size = 6))
```

Comment: We could observe New York, NY has the smallest OR and
Albuquerque, NM has the largest OR.

## Problem 2

**The boostrap is helpful when you'd like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn't have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We'll focus on a
simple linear regression with `tmax` as the response with `tmin` and
`prcp` as the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two
quantities estimated from these data:**

- $\hat{r}^2$

- $log(\hat{\beta_1} * \hat{\beta_2})$

**Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for** $\hat{r}^2$ **and**
$log(\hat{\beta_0} * \hat{\beta_1})$**. Note: `broom::glance()` is
helpful for extracting** $\hat{r}^2$ **from a fitted regression, and
`broom::tidy()` (with some additional wrangling) should help in
computing** $log(\hat{\beta_1} * \hat{\beta_2})$**.**

``` r
# load the dataset
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),

    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())

Comment: We could observe that values r^2 are all close to 1, which
means there’re strong linear relation and tmin and prcp are good
indicators of tmax. Also, the distribution is approximately as normal
distribution but left-skewed.

## Problem 3

**Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric
to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).**

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use `add_predictions` and `add_residuals` in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

- One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
  effects only)

- One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
  (including the three-way interaction) between these

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use `crossv_mc` and functions in `purrr` as appropriate.
